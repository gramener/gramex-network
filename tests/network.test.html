  The network.js script will be loaded by the test environment (happy-dom)
  as part of the test setup, not directly in this HTML.
  Alternatively, if tests are run in a browser or an environment that
  resolves modules from HTML, it could be:
  <script type="module" src="../network.js"></script>
  For happy-dom with local file access, the test script will load and execute this.
